=Using Dynamic Row Format=

The new feature is exposed through block_size and row format options.

For example:

{{{
create table t1 (
    a int not null,
    b int,
    c varchar(400),
    d varchar(400),
    primary key (a), key (b))
  engine=heap block_size=24;
}}}

{{{
create table t1 (
    a int not null,
    b int,
    c varchar(400),
    d varchar(400),
    primary key (a), key (b))
  engine=heap row_format=dynamic;
}}}

Note that {{{row_format=dynamic}}} will use {{{block_size}}} of 240.

Use {{{"show table status"}}} to find average per-row memory consumption. Note that in a table with few rows, per-row memory consumption will show high numbers due to larger {{{HP_BLOCK}}} allocation granularity.

As always, don't forget to set {{{max_heap_table_size}}} and {{{max_rows}}} properly.
